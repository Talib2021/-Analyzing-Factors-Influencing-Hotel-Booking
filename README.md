# Hotel Cancellation Analysis

## Overview

The **Hotel Cancellation Analysis** project focuses on understanding the factors that influence booking cancellations in city and resort hotels. By analyzing historical booking data, this project identifies patterns and trends that lead to cancellations. The insights gained from this analysis can help hotels optimize their booking strategies, enhance customer retention, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- **Identify Factors Influencing Cancellations**: Understand key factors contributing to booking cancellations in both city and resort hotels.
- **Optimize Booking Strategies**: Provide actionable insights for improving hotel booking processes and reducing cancellations.
- **Improve Customer Retention**: Use data-driven strategies to improve customer satisfaction and retention by identifying booking behaviors that predict cancellations.
- **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Apply feature transformation and selection techniques to improve the predictive power of models.

## Techniques Used

- **Feature Transformation**: Preprocessing and transforming the features to improve the accuracy of the models.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most important features that contribute to cancellations, ensuring better model performance and interpretability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing patterns and trends in booking data using visualizations and statistical methods.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning algorithms to predict booking cancellations.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code (for development)
